# factory

This repository generates various fresh apps every midnight (UTC time).

## Why?

Instead of having to run a script to generate a new project each time, you can just fork the templates and begin coding.

- Use [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to work on the project right away.

- Unlike many boilerplates, our fresh apps are regenerated **daily**, so you get up-to-date dependencies by the time you clone them.
